{
The second project of this company was an automation service for pathobiology
labs. From creating a microscope that automatically scans slides to create a web
application for managing slides and patients. My task was diagnosing cancer
potential cells from scaned images. We've reached the accurracy of about 60\% in finding
the cells in images with Mask-RCNN and about 94\% in classification of the cells.

\section{Selected Projects}
\cvitem{2017 -- now}{\textbf{Chillin:} A tool for creating game AI competitions. It consists of multiple components, including a \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-PyServer}{\color{blue}{server framework}} written in Python, three client components written in \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-PyClient}{\color{blue}{Python}}, \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-CppClient}{\color{blue}{C++}}, and \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-JavaClient}{\color{blue}{Java}}. Also, Chillin came up with a \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-Monitor-2}{\color{blue}{3D monitor}} created with Unity to spectate the games and watch what happens in the field. \newline \href{https://2017.chillinwars.ir}{\color{blue}{ChillinWars 2017}} and \href{https://chillinwars.ir}{\color{blue}{ChillinWars 2019}} utilized this tool to create games for their competitions. Some examples can be found \href{https://github.com/Chillin-Examples}{\color{blue}{here}}.}

\cvitem{2018 -- 2019}{\textbf{Musical Chord Detection:} An application that detects \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note}{\color{blue}{musical notes}} in a musical signal (created by Piano, Guitar, and etc). It's a very difficult problem and still isn't solved completely. Typically there exists 108 different notes and detecting a single note is kind of simple but the problem shows up when some notes are played simultaneously (chords). Imagine if someone plays 10 Piano notes with his 10 fingers, then there could be almost 100\^{}10 possible different chords. Solving this problem using basic ANN algorithms is not actually possible.}

\cvitem{Spring 2020}{\textbf{CHROMEISTER:} Implementation of \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-46773-w}{CHROMEISTER} in python, with some improvements too! \href{https://github.com/M6stafa/CHROMEISTER}{\color{blue}{Github link}}}

\cvitem{Fall 2018}{\textbf{MathExam:} An Electron+Vuejs pc application that provides some tools for managing school exams and questions. Also complex questions (containing equations, etc) were supported by help of Mathjax.}

\cvitem{Fall 2017}{\textbf{Algorithm Visualization:} Visualize some sorting algorithms using Vuejs and D3js.}

\cvitem{2015/10}{\textbf{Ragdoll:} An arcade game created by Unity. \href{https://cafebazaar.ir/app/com.khaste.ragdoll/}{\color{blue}{Download link}}}

\cvitem{2011 -- 2013}{\textbf{Robocup 3D Soccer Simulation} Robocup 3D Soccer Simulation is a seniors' tournament that is a part of robotics tournaments like IranOpen. Its goal is to write a code that manages 11 simulated \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nao_(robot)}{\color{blue}{NAO robots}} to play soccer. What I've done in team was writing Forward and Inverse Kinematics and Walking. I've tested several methods for implementation of the walking like ANN and sinusoidal foot trajectories and some methods for optimizing them like PSO and GeneticAlgorithm. Our TDP which was sent for and got quilified in World Championship 2013 competitions can be found \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/nkwcxfojufvafgt/3d_tdp_s4m.pdf?dl=0}{\color{blue}{here}}. \href{https://gitlab.com/4/4d-simulation}{\color{blue}{Gitlab link}}.}

\cvitem{Winter 2012}{\textbf{Othello:} An object-oriented client/server platform providing an interface for othello AI programs written in C++. Uses Boost Asio and SDL.}

\cvitem{2011 -- 2012}{\textbf{Car Tracking:} A dynamic system that detects cars and their movements. \href{https://github.com/AminHP/CarTracking}{\color{blue}{Github link}}}

\cvitem{2011 -- 2012}{\textbf{Inverted Pendulum:} A system which simulates the famous \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum}{\color{blue}{Inverted Pendulum}} problem written in C++. Also an AI is implemented that uses Q-Learning to keep the pendulum inverted in the system.}

\cvitem{2010 -- 2011}{\textbf{NabRai Signal Processing Lab Project:} Classify voice to realize some words. Project written in matlab.}

\cvitem{2009 -- 2010}{\textbf{Othello:} My very first complete project that written in C++. You can play othello with an AI that implemented with min-max tree.}
